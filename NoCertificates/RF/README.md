# Cold War Spies and Wi-Fi: Soviet Satellites Over America and Starlink in Irbid

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
This project showcases the advancements in satellite communications technology by examining two distinct aspects: the potential use of Molniya orbit satellites for surveillance during the Cold War and the implementation of a Starlink satellite network to provide internet coverage in Irbid, Jordan.
</p>

### Molniya Orbit Satellites
<p align="justify">
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed and deployed Molniya orbit satellites, which were designed for communications over the high latitudes of the Soviet Union. These satellites were highly elliptical, spending most of their time over the northern hemisphere, which made them particularly useful for maintaining prolonged communication over Russia and parts of North America. The unique orbital characteristics of Molniya satellites provided better coverage and reduced power requirements compared to geostationary satellites, making them ideal for high-latitude regions.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In this project, we simulate the potential use of Molniya orbit satellites for surveillance over the United States, particularly focusing on Washington, D.C., to understand their capabilities during the Cold War.

To see what actually happens more clearly, please download the simulation files and run them locally. High quality videos/GIFs are too large to be rendered and displayed quickly if at all on GitHub.

#### SpySat Coverage of Washington

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The SpySat sees Washington, D.C. for approximately 16 hours a day. The access summary report and the timeline graph below highlight the specific periods when Washington is within the satellite's view.

### Starlink Internet Coverage in Irbid
<p align="justify">
The primary focus of this project is the implementation of a Starlink satellite network to provide internet coverage in Irbid, Jordan. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, aims to deliver high-speed internet across the globe using a constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. This part of the project involves designing, simulating, and evaluating the performance of the Starlink network in providing reliable internet access, including performance metrics such as Bit Error Rate (BER), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and interference management.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For tracking and selecting the Starlink satellites, we utilized the invaluable <a href="https://satellitemap.space">satellitemap</a> website, which provides real-time positions of Starlink satellites. This tool helped in picking 10 Starlink satellites within the same orbital plane, checking their next passes over Jordan, and evaluating their performance for internet coverage in Irbid.

## Further Details
<p align="justify">
For understanding the methodologies and findings, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/HashemRawashdeh/Cold-War-Spies-and-Wi-Fi--Soviet-Satellites-Over-America-and-Starlink-in-Irbid/blob/main/Starlink%20Irbid/Report.pdf">report</a> included in this repository. The report was initially created to supplement a comprehensive presentation of the simulation to the course instructor. While it provides an overview of the general methodology, design, and performance, it does not encompass every detail. The primary objective of this report was to meet the formal submission requirements, and it can be easily improved for a more stringent objective.
